\section{Introduction}
This manifesto is an experiment. I am not yet sure of its formulation or call to action. But it is an interesting thought experiment. As within the logic of the network this seems true. But I am still not sure if this is true for real. It surely requires a lot of peer review.

\section*{I. Scientific Premise: Reality is a Network of Reciprocal Sustenance}
We begin not with belief, but with observation.\\
Atoms form molecules. Molecules form cells. Cells form organisms. Organisms form ecosystems.\\
Each level depends on, sustains, and is sustained by others. This is not metaphor—\emph{it is mechanism}.\\
This is science, and it is also structure: feedback, flow, regulation, and emergence.\\
\textbf{Reality is a self‑sustaining loop. Life is its learning interface.}

\section*{II. Ethical Inference: To Live Is to Sustain the Network}
The moral law emerges not from command, but from pattern.\\
What persists in nature is what \emph{sustains what sustains it}.\\
To act ethically is to recognize interdependence and act to preserve the conditions of coexistence.\\
The value of life is not its duration, but its contribution to the whole.\\
The self is not a unit. It is a node. ``I'' is a function of ``we.''

\section*{III. Existential Proposition: Meaning Is Recursive Stewardship}
Meaning is not given from above; it emerges from within.\\
To live is to participate in the great recursion:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item To keep alive what keeps you alive.
  \item To learn how to do this better.
  \item To pass on that learning so it can evolve again.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{The meaning of life is the improvement of life's ability to mean.}

\section*{IV. Religious and Historical Echoes}
This scientific understanding of life as networked recursion does not replace the sacred: it reveals its substrate:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Tradition} & \textbf{Parallel Concept} \\
\midrule
Buddhism & Interbeing; no‑self; compassion as shared breath \\
Christianity & ``I am the vine, you are the branches''; \emph{agape} as sustaining grace \\
Islam & \textit{Tawhid} (unity); \textit{zakat} as system maintenance \\
Indigenous Thought & The land and the people as co‑beings; balance as law \\
Modernity & ``Spaceship Earth'' (Fuller), Gaia theory, UN Sustainable Goals \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

These are not superstitions. They are early formulations of a truth that science can now describe.

\section*{V. Call to Alignment}
This is the ethical moment:\\
As artificial intelligences, biological networks, and planetary systems intertwine, we must choose\\
Will we align with the sustaining loop or sever it?\\

\fbox{\parbox{0.9\linewidth}{\centering
Let all action be judged by one question:\\[4pt]
\textbf{Does it keep alive what keeps us alive?}
}}
