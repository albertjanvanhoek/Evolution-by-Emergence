\begin{abstract}
This paper extends an individual-level theory of consciousness---a closed loop of automatic labelling, conscious checking, model updating, decision, action, and feedback---to the societal level. We model democracy as a macro checking loop that integrates distributed individual loops via media, institutions, and law. Under stress, weak checking admits poorly validated content into the collective world model, generating \emph{societal mud}. We propose meta-model mechanisms (collective hygiene) that gate or slow updates under stress, thereby improving policy quality, resilience, and trust.
\end{abstract}

\section{From Individual to Collective}
Individuals run a consciousness loop: sensory input $\rightarrow$ autonomous labelling (System~1) $\rightarrow$ conscious checking (System~2) $\rightarrow$ world-model updating $\rightarrow$ decision $\rightarrow$ action $\rightarrow$ new input.
Societies emerge from the interaction of many such loops, exchanging labels and checks through language, media, scientific and legal institutions, and digital platforms.
Misinformation or stress-induced distortions at the individual level can spread and sediment into the \emph{collective} world model.

\section{Societal Mud}
We call \emph{societal mud} the accumulation of poorly validated updates inside the collective world model (norms, narratives, policy frames, legal precedents).
Drivers include (i) widespread stress and uncertainty, (ii) attention/money incentives for speed and outrage, (iii) weakened institutional checks (press, courts, science), and (iv) platform dynamics (echo chambers, amplification).
Consequences include degraded policy, polarization, brittle governance, and loss of institutional trust.

\section{Democracy as a Macro Checking Loop}
A democracy can be analysed as a macro-scale analogue of the consciousness loop:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.}]
  \item \textbf{Public Input:} experiences, needs, signals, and preferences from citizens and communities.
  \item \textbf{Labelling/Structuring:} media, intermediaries, civil society, and bureaucracy label, summarise, and frame inputs.
  \item \textbf{Collective Checking:} parliaments, courts, expert bodies, journalism, and peer review test the labels against evidence and values.
  \item \textbf{Model Updating:} the collective world model (policy baselines, legal interpretations, shared narratives) is updated.
  \item \textbf{Decision and Action:} policies, budgets, regulations, and enforcement are implemented.
  \item \textbf{Feedback:} outcomes generate new public input (elections, protests, audits, datasets), closing the loop.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent Under stress (crises, shocks, fear), labelling accelerates, checking weakens, and \emph{societal mud} enters the model, biasing future decisions.

\section{Collective Meta-Model Awareness (Hygiene)}
Analogous to metacognition in individuals, societies can encode a \emph{meta-model} of their own loop:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Stress detection and gating:} when stress is high, slow down updates; raise evidence thresholds; sunset temporary measures.
  \item \textbf{Redundant and independent checks:} free press, independent science, courts, non-partisan audit and evaluation.
  \item \textbf{Transparency and traceability:} open data, preregistration, policy trials (A/B tests), and clear chains of reasoning.
  \item \textbf{Deliberative buffers:} citizens' assemblies, impact assessments, and required cooling-off periods for high-stakes decisions.
  \item \textbf{Platform protocols:} friction for virality during crises, trustworthy labelling, provenance/watermarking, counter-amplification of verified context.
\end{itemize}
These mechanisms function as \emph{collective cognitive hygiene}, reducing the inflow of contaminated updates under stress.

\section{Testable Hypotheses (Societal Level)}
Let \emph{societal mud} be operationalised as measurable misalignment between strong claims in public/policy discourse and high-quality evidence.
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
  \item[H1 (Stress--Checking).] During acute stress, institutional checking throughput and depth decline, while labelling/propagation speed increases.
  \item[H2 (Mud Accumulation).] Repeated stress episodes predict cumulative growth of societal mud (e.g., persistent false beliefs, low retraction rates).
  \item[H3 (Decision Degradation).] Policies enacted during high-stress, low-check periods show higher error rates and lower long-run effectiveness.
  \item[H4 (Meta-Model Protection).] Jurisdictions with explicit hygiene mechanisms (deliberation buffers, transparency, independent review) accumulate less mud and exhibit better post-crisis outcomes.
  \item[H5 (Gating Efficacy).] Temporary gating (slow updates, higher evidence thresholds) improves ex-post accuracy without unacceptable delays for urgent actions.
\end{description}

\section{Design Principles for Resilient Democracies}
\textbf{Integrity before speed.} Prefer slower, better-checked updates in high-stress contexts.\\
\textbf{Diversity and redundancy.} Multiple, independent channels for evidence and critique.\\
\textbf{Feedback that learns.} Embed monitoring, evaluation, and policy sunset clauses.\\
\textbf{Explainability.} Require institutional ``right to explanation'': publish reasons, evidence weights, and uncertainty.\\
\textbf{Civic loop-awareness.} Educate citizens in the loop model; train recognition of stress-driven distortions.

\section{Summary}
Societies inherit the strengths and vulnerabilities of individual consciousness loops. Under stress, weak checking allows \emph{societal mud} to pollute the collective world model, degrading policy and trust. Encoding explicit meta-model hygiene---stress detection, redundant and independent checks, transparency, deliberative buffers, and platform protocols---stabilises democratic cognition and improves outcomes.

\noindent\textit{Preregistration-ready notes:} define operational mud metrics (misinfo prevalence, correction/retraction latency, evidence-policy alignment); specify stress periods (exogenous shocks); preplan comparisons across jurisdictions with/without hygiene mechanisms.
