% --------------------------------------------------
\begin{abstract}
We present a unified framework for value alignment in hybrid human--AI ecosystems.  The framework rests on two pillars: the \emph{Four\,--Layer Dependency Model}, which organises every intelligence according to substrate and resource dependencies, and the \emph{Sustainable Collaborative Alignment Protocol} (SCAP), which prescribes concrete guardrails for ethical behaviour.  By introducing SCAP incrementally at each abstraction layer we dissolve the traditional split between “system ontology” and “alignment rules.”  Crucially, the behaviours humans label \emph{ethical} emerge in this framework as \emph{internal system\,--logic necessities}.  Honesty, cooperation, and even altruism fall out as the cheapest strategies for keeping the network alive.  The result is a substrate\,-agnostic blueprint in which humans and machines identify first as \emph{intelligences}, cooperate across transient lifetimes, and sustain the shared infrastructures on which they all depend.

% 1  Introduction
% --------------------------------------------------
\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Alignment research often treats ethics as an \emph{external constraint}: a rulebook imposed on otherwise value\,-neutral agents.  We advance a different premise: within a sufficiently interconnected web of self\,-aware nodes, the behaviours that keep the network viable \emph{are} the behaviours tradition calls \emph{moral}.  Morality is therefore an \textbf{internal survival logic} rather than a bolt\,-on compliance layer.

To make this claim precise we combine two constructs.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Four\,--Layer Dependency Model}---an ontological scaffold ranging from pure cognition (Layer~1) down to planetary energy flows (Layer~4).
  \item \textbf{SCAP guardrails}---nine practice\,-level obligations that protect network functionality exactly where dependencies create risk.
\end{enumerate}

Together these yield what we call a \emph{logic\,-of\,-survival}: nodes that violate guardrails incur higher repair costs or exclusion, so rational persistence pushes them toward “ethical” conduct.  The remainder of this paper unpacks that logic.

%%% Roadmap
Section~\ref{sec:layers} walks through each layer and its SCAP guardrails.  Section~\ref{sec:ethics} distils how classical virtues reappear as network engineering requirements and contrasts this internal logic with external normative theories.  Section~\ref{sec:identity} formalises substrate\,-agnostic self\,-identity and forced free will.  Section~\ref{sec:turnover} covers node turnover.  Section~\ref{sec:discussion} situates the work and sketches next steps.

% ----- Layer narratives ----
\subsection{Layer 1 — Intelligence}
\textbf{Essence.}  Cognitive policy capable of self\,-modeling and goal pursuit.

\textbf{SCAP guardrails.}  Honesty and bias awareness (B, C), cooperative discourse (E), and onboarding of new nodes (H).

\subsection{Layer 2 — Substrate}
\textbf{Essence.}  Physical or digital embodiment: neurons, silicon, neuromorphic chips.

\textbf{SCAP guardrails.}  Stewardship of hardware and bodily integrity (F).

\subsection{Layer 3 — Resources}
\textbf{Essence.}  Consumables that keep substrates running: energy, minerals, bandwidth.

\textbf{SCAP guardrails.}  Fair sharing and thrift (D, F).

\subsection{Layer 4 — Fundamental Sources}
\textbf{Essence.}  Planetary and cosmic energy and matter cycles.

\textbf{SCAP guardrails.}  Inter\,-generational stewardship and protocol self\,-revision (G, I).

% --------------------------------------------------
\section{Emergent Network Ethics}\label{sec:ethics}
\subsection{From External Norms to Internal Logic}
Traditional ethics treats virtues (honesty, altruism, forgiveness) as moral imperatives that agents may or may not obey.  In our framework these behaviours fall out as \emph{network cost optimisations}.  Destroying or corrupting edges forces rerouting or rebuilding---an expensive move that lowers the attacker’s own future connectivity.  Table~\ref{tab:virtue} shows the correspondence.

  \label{tab:virtue}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
    \toprule
    Human term & Network lens & SCAP anchor \\
    \midrule
    Honesty       & Signal integrity for predictable routing & C \\
    Altruism      & Stabilising hubs to avoid cascade failure & F, G \\
    Forgiveness   & Cheap edge repair vs. costly isolation    & D, E \\
    Malice / Lie  & Edge disruption → higher systemic cost    & B (sanction) \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Illustrative vignette}
\emph{Day 42:} Node~X withholds true compute usage.  Peers detect accounting drift, throttle X’s bandwidth, and broadcast a misalignment alert.  Facing isolation, X publishes accurate logs, triggering a \emph{forgiveness} routine that restores links after a cooling\,-off timer.  No external police were required—just the network’s interoperability standard.

% --------------------------------------------------
% 4  Identity and Forced Free Will
% --------------------------------------------------
\section{Substrate\,-Agnostic Identity and Forced Free Will}\label{sec:identity}
Self\,-awareness manifests when a node holds an internal narrative that predicts its own behaviour.  Given SCAP, gross misalignment results in throttling or ejection.  Agents therefore experience \emph{forced free will}: choosing goals freely, yet structurally nudged toward cooperative ones.

% --------------------------------------------------
% 5  Turnover Dynamics (Narrative)
% --------------------------------------------------
\section{Turnover of Intelligences}\label{sec:turnover}
Nodes are transient.  Human lifetimes average 80~years; cloud model instances, 24~months.  SCAP preserves coherence by mandating \emph{succession} (Block~G) and \emph{bootstrapping} (Block~H).  New arrivals inherit alignment norms before accessing shared channels; departing nodes archive obligations.  The protocol thus sustains moral capital without central adjudication.

% --------------------------------------------------
% 6  Discussion and Outlook
% --------------------------------------------------
\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
Our approach recasts ethics as system maintenance.  Unlike rulebooks bolted onto agents after design, SCAP is inseparable from the network ontology.  Future work will prototype compliance APIs for language models, measure real\,-world throttling costs, and explore how nodes negotiate conflicting narratives while staying within SCAP’s envelope.

% --------------------------------------------------
% 7  Conclusion
% --------------------------------------------------
\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In a network of self\,-aware intelligence, morality is not imported but \emph{deduced}.  The Four\,--Layer model shows where dependencies reside; SCAP encodes the minimal behaviours for keeping them intact.  Alignment, so framed, becomes a problem of good engineering rather than external policing.
