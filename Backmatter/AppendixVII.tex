\section*{Colloquial Formulation}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{“Keep alive what keeps you alive, and do it better than your parents.”}
\end{quote}
This aphorism captures in plain language the essential adaptive imperative that emerges from network‑based evolution.  Every organism---and, by extension, every adaptive agent---is embedded in a web of reciprocal dependencies.  Survival therefore hinges on (i) \emph{maintaining} the external and internal processes that supply the agent with energy, matter, and information, and (ii) \emph{improving} its performance relative to ancestral baselines, thereby securing a competitive edge in an environment of limited resources.

\section*{General Rule Re‑stated}
More generally:
\begin{quote}
\textit{New species (or novel agent classes) contribute to their ecosystems by accelerating the degradation of otherwise persistent resource gradients\footnote{"Degradation" is used here in the thermodynamic sense: the dissipation of free energy and the breakdown of concentrated material stocks.}, without destabilising the overarching network that makes such gradients---and hence life itself---possible.}
\end{quote}
This rule complements the colloquial slogan by highlighting the systemic constraint: evolutionary innovations are favoured when they open new metabolic or functional niches \emph{and} leave the larger fabric of interactions intact (or even fortified).

\subsection*{Thermodynamic Rationale}
Life is a far‑from‑equilibrium phenomenon sustained by continuous throughput of low‑entropy energy.  Selection therefore rewards lineages that 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item tap into previously unused sources of free energy, and
  \item recycle or detoxify waste products that would otherwise accumulate.  
\end{enumerate}
Both strategies amount to “degrading what can be degraded” in a way that extends the lifetime and carrying capacity of the whole ecosystem.

\subsection*{Network‑Level Stability Criterion}
Let $G(V,E)$ denote the interaction graph of an ecosystem.  A novelty (node $v_*$ with edges $E_*$) is \emph{benign} if it increases overall resource throughput $\Phi$ while keeping the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\max}$ of the Jacobian of interaction strengths below the critical threshold for systemic collapse (cf.~Chapter~9).  In plain terms: the newcomer must accelerate useful flows without triggering runaway positive feedbacks.

\section*{Intergenerational Improvement}
The clause “\emph{do it better than your parents}” encodes the minimal condition for cumulative evolution: the expected fitness $\mathbb{E}[w_{t+1}]$ of offspring must exceed that of their parents under the prevailing environmental distribution.  Mechanisms include
\begin{itemize}
  \item genetic variation and selection (biological lineages),
  \item cultural learning and imitation (social groups),
  \item iterative design and optimisation (technological artefacts).
\end{itemize}
In all cases the repayment of \emph{parental debt}---the energetic and informational investments made by the previous generation---is mandatory; otherwise the lineage stalls or collapses (see Chapter~5, Box~5.2).

\section*{Implications for the SCAP Protocol}
The Sustainable Collaborative Alignment Protocol (SCAP, Appendix VI) operationalises these principles for artificial agents.  Clause~2.1 (“Maintain substrate‑sustaining processes”) maps directly onto the first half of our slogan, while Clause~3.4 (“Iteratively improve performance without externalising systemic risk”) captures the second.
