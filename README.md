## Abstract / Overview

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for the book *Evolution by Emergence: A Universal Theory of Networks, Life, and Mind*.
The book presents an interdisciplinary exploration into the interconnected web of interactions underpinning existence. It introduces and applies the **Evolution by Emergence paradigm**, a framework asserting that evolution is a universal process driven by network dynamics, feedback, and selection, applicable far beyond the biological realm. We weave together insights from network theory, complexity science, evolutionary biology, artificial intelligence, and philosophy to reveal how simple, local interactions give rise to complex, adaptive systemsâ€”and ultimately, to the emergence of cooperation, societal norms, and the concept termed **Forced Free Will** (or Constrained Agency and Network Alignment).
This work is the product of a unique collaboration between human insight (Albert Jan van Hoek) and artificial intelligence (ChatGPT and Gemini), reflecting a new paradigm of writing and research. The authorship process is detailed within the book itself.
**As this is a work in progress, the content, structure, and bibliography are subject to ongoing refinement and change.**

## Key Concepts Explored

* **Evolution by Emergence Paradigm:** A proposed universal framework for evolution across diverse systems (biological, geological, social, technological).
* **Network Perspective:** Emphasis on dynamic networks over static lineages in evolution.
* **Feedback Loops & Interdependence:** Central roles in driving system dynamics and adaptation.
* **Competition & Collaboration:** Dual forces shaping emergent order.
* **Forced Free Will / Constrained Agency:** The idea that choices are fundamentally constrained by network dynamics and imperatives for persistence.
* **Universality:** Application of principles to non-living systems (e.g., mineral evolution) and potential artificial consciousness.
* **Sustainable Collaborative Alignment Protocol (SCAP):** A proposed ethical and operational framework derived from the paradigm (see Appendix).

## Repository Content

This repository contains the full LaTeX source code for the book, including:
* `.tex` files for chapters, preface, appendix, etc.
* Bibliography files (`.bib`)
* The main `main.tex` file which compiles the entire document. 

## Technology & Workflow

* **Format:** LaTeX (`book` document class)
* **Editing Environment:** Primarily developed using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) and synchronized with this GitHub repository.
* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub.
* **Archival & DOI:** Intended for archival on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) to obtain a persistent DOI upon official releases.


## Current Status & Call for Feedback

**Please Note:** This book is currently a **work in progress** (currently Version 0.88). The content is actively being developed, refined, and expanded by the authors.

* **Literature & Bibliography:** The list of supporting literature and the bibliography within the book are **not yet exhaustive**. They represent the references incorporated so far and will be significantly augmented in future versions.
* **Completeness:** While the core arguments and structure are largely in place, some sections may require further elaboration, evidence, or refinement. We appreciate your understanding that this is not the final version.

**Feedback & Collaboration Welcome:**
Constructive feedback is highly valuable to us during this development phase. We welcome suggestions for improvement, identification of errors or inconsistencies, pointers to relevant research we may have missed, or general thoughts on the concepts presented.

Please feel free to:
* Open an [**Issue**]([https://github.com/albertjanvanhoek/Evolution-by-Emergence/issues](https://github.com/albertjanvanhoek/Evolution-by-Emergence/issues)) on this GitHub repository to provide detailed feedback or suggest specific changes/additions. 
We are open to discussion and appreciate engagement with the ideas presented in this ongoing project. Potential collaboration inquiries based on shared research interests are also welcome.
